# to expose it directly to users. Instead, we will create a custom wrapper
# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a

# Create a wrapper function for the component. This is an optional

# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    key: str or None
